# solving_sudoku_computervision

Computer vision has been lionized in the recent trends of information technology world. Because of its enormous application and features, it has been gaining limelight for solving real world complex problems which are beyond human intelligence. Extending this artificial intelligence marvel to conventional life makes it useful and convenient. Sudoku has become a part of amusement in many lives which is ubiquitous in many articles news papers, magazine and apps. So imbibing computer vision techniques to solve the Sudoku puzzle is upshot of this paper. We have employed some of the prominent tools like Open CV, OCR, Tensorflow. The paper explains the methodology with which we have used these tools to solve the Sudoku puzzle. The methodology shown in the paper involves several stages such as image preprocessing and image extraction using OpenCV, OCRing the numerical data from the extracted image using Tesseract and finally feeding the numerical data extracted to the neural network(tensorflow) model to get the desired output. The main motivation of our research is to develop up a help device for Sudoku players, for example urging players to tackle the hard Sudoku puzzles or when looking for help. It is troublesome at various stages and simple to artful players, particularly for new players or individuals insufficient certainty or endurance. The input data, comes from the camera or as an image.
